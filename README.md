Here, I've studied and done research over Azure Form Recognizer Tool to extract the Invoice info and get Json of that info.
We have Invoice with different layouts, keywords, formats, so we need to extract info from the invoice and convert that into a single format.
We have multiple client with different format of invoices, that we need to convert into a single format for internal use or to deliver to another client.
